Likewise, if we picked from a distribution where every character is equally likely we won't get anything interesting either, just jibberish. We need a way to control the randomness (stochasticity) in our probability distribution of next characters. We'll achieve this by introducing a softmax temperature so that we can dial in exactly how much randomness we want. Then we'll let our network pick from these, the advantage of this is that if the letter E has a 0.3 probability, instead of not being picked, we'll pick it 30% of the time. This allows unlikely characters to become part of the sequence too and makes our results more flexible and interesting."
